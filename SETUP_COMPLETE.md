## 🎯 What Makes This Different

Compared to your previous Skill Sprint project:

✅ **Modern Stack**: Vite + React instead of single HTML file
✅ **Hot Reload**: Changes appear instantly without refresh
✅ **TypeScript**: Type safety catches errors before runtime
✅ **Component Architecture**: Easier to maintain and extend
✅ **No GitHub Dependency**: Edit locally, see changes immediately
✅ **Professional Setup**: Industry-standard tooling and structure

## 💡 Tips

1. **Keep the dev server running** - It auto-reloads on file changes
2. **Use the sidebar** - Quick access to export/import
3. **Export regularly** - Save backups before major changes
4. **Use bullet points** - Start lines with `-` in descriptions
5. **Check CLAUDE.md** - Detailed info on all features

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server not running?
```bash
npm run dev
```

### See errors in browser?
- Check browser console (F12)
- Look for TypeScript errors in terminal
- Try `npm install` again

### Data not saving?
- Make sure you're in edit mode
- Check if localStorage is enabled
- Not in private/incognito mode
